                                Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.

                                ISO management system standards (MSS) help organizations improve their performance by specifying repeatable steps that organizations consciously implement to achieve their goals and objectives, and to create an organizational culture that reflexively engages in a continuous cycle of self-evaluation, correction and improvement of operations and processes through heightened employee awareness and management leadership and commitment.

                                What is a network server? Network servers are computers that are used as the central repository for data and various programs, and are shared by many users within the network.
Users may have programs and files they retain on their own PCs or laptops. But certain files and programs are better hosted on one of the many network servers on the market. That enables other users to access them by connecting to that server via the network.

                                Network baselining is the act of measuring and rating the performance of a network in real-time situations. Providing a network baseline requires testing and reporting of the physical connectivity, normal network utilization, protocol usage, peak network utilization, and average throughput of the network usage.

                                Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a way for different devices on a network to share information with one another. It allows devices to communicate even if the devices are different hardware and run different software. Without a protocol like SNMP, there would be no way for network management tools to identify devices, monitor network performance, keep track of changes to the network, or determine the status of network devices in real time.
